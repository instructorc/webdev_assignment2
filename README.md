# Overview

For assignment 2, you will continue to think through the details of your site by defining the information architecture of your site, creating high-fidelity wire-frames, and developing multiple user profiles for your site.  Requirement 1 will ask you to create a site map of your website's content.  Requirement 2 requires you to create several wire-frames for the various layouts your site will have.  Requirement 3 is going to have you create CSS style rules and place them into an external document. Requirement 4 simply provides instructions on how you will submit and upload the assignment.
